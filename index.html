    </p>
    <p>
    <em>While many fans of the band Swans would not set this album above the
    bands 2014 record "To Be Kind",</br> it sits as my number one due to my love for
    the bleak and hopeless emotions the album presents in context</br> with the 1980s
    NYC scene the album was created in.</em>
    </p>
    <!-- Album 2 -->
    <h3><strong>2. To be Kind (2014)</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <img src="swans-tobekind.jpeg" alt="To be Kind" />
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>To be Kind, the album a lot of people will put as their #1. This album is a
    monster of a Rock composition</br> with every musical corner of Swans packed into
    one with a runtime of just 2 hours. Even with how highly</br> acclaimed this
    album is within the bands discography, it is still not for the casual music
    listener as this project</br> has a lot to unpack.</em>
    </p>
    <!-- Album 3 -->
    <h3><strong>3. White Light from the Mouth of Infinity (1981)</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <img src="swans-whitelight.jpeg" alt="White Light" width="315px" />
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>This is one of the groups earlier projects that would follow their 1987 sophmore album "Children of God".</br> This was at the time where the group was still following
    heavy and rhythmic roots and more traditional song</br> writing that brought them to where they are today.</em>
